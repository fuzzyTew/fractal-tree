## setup 

1. go install node using NVM by creationix (duckduckgo it)
2. clone this repo down
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run build` 
  - this bundles all the js code into `build.js`
  - you can use `npm run watch` to run a process which will run the build any time the js changes
  - if the `build.js` is too big, we can do some minification later
5. open `index.html`


This refactoring isn't complete: 
  - [ ] alpha slider broken
  - [ ] presets not yet refactored
  - [ ] keyboard shortcuts not refactored
